;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(if IS-WINDOWS
    (setq liszt-home "C:/Liszt")
  (setq liszt-home "~"))

(when (display-graphic-p)
  (defun set-font (english chinese english-size chinese-size)
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font
                        (format   "%s:pixelsize=%d"  english english-size))
    (dolist (charset '(kana han symbol cjk-misc bopomofo))
      (set-fontset-font (frame-parameter nil 'font) charset
                        (font-spec :family chinese :size chinese-size))))
  (set-font "Fira Code" "kaiti" 20 24)
  )

(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory (concat liszt-home "/Notes")
      org-archive-location (concat org-directory "/Archives/%s::")
      org-roam-directory (concat org-directory "/Roam")
      org-roam-tag-sources '(prop last-directory)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
